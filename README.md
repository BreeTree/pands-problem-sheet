# Solutions to Weekly Problem Sheets 

## Description 
These files are coded in python. They were developed as solutions to problems set as weekly tasks by Andrew Beatty for a Programming and Scripting course being run online as part of a Data Analytics Course by GMIT, 2022. 

## How to use
Scripts created using Visual Studio. Scripts can be run in command line interpreters or code editors such as Visual Studio. 

### Table  of Contents
#### bmi.py
A program using python operators to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height input by a user

### collatz.py
A program using python lists and the while loop to perform the Collatz conjecture on an integer input by a user. 

### es.py
A program which counts the number of e's in a text file of the novel Moby Dick. The program uses the sys module and related arguments to open a file from the command line. A function is defined to use to open function to open and read the file. Once the file is read, the e's can be counted and printed. 

### plottask.py
A program is created using the matplotlib and numpy modules of python to create a plot.

### secondstring.py
A program which reverses inputted text and skips characters by using the slice syntax of python. 

### squareroot.py 
A program which calculates the square root of a positive number using Newton's Method. 

### weekday.py
A program which uses the datetime module to compute the day of the week and if/else statements to output different comments depending on the day.
